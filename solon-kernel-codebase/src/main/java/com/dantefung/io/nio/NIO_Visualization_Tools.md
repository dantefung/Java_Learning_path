You can find two GUI demo tools that I developed a while back to help visualize the way NIO Buffers and Selectors work. These are ready-to-run JARs, just do 'java -jar bufferdemo.jar' or 'java -jar selectdemo.jar' to run them. No need to set the classpath. On Windows and Mac, if things are setup properly, you can just double-click the icon for the jar file.
